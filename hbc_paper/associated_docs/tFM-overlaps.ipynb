    "This notebook is me trying to estimate the probability of echo-call overlap in the 2  and 3 bat cases. An overlap is defined in the sense of two sounds having an overlap in time, however small eg. even if sound A is from 0-3ms and sound B is from 3-6 ms, this is also considered an overlap. Essentially, it mimics the case of temporal masking, and is thus a worst-case scenario type assumption. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulations place *N* sounds of given duration into a call+inter-pulse length window independently, and then check for overlaps among the sounds. For a given *M* runs, the number of runs with at least one overlap are counted and this rate is reported as the probability rate. \n",
